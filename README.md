Aura-Mosaic üõçÔ∏è

Modern MERN e-commerce with AI assistance, reviews, and clean UX.

Overview

Aura-Mosaic is a full-stack store built with React (Vite/CRA) on the frontend and Node.js + Express + MongoDB on the backend. It supports browsing products by category, powerful search & filters, cart and wishlist (gated to signed-in users), order history, ratings & reviews, and an AI assistant (chat, recommendations, gifting bundles, and product comparison). Authentication uses JWT (with logout via blacklist) and optional Google Sign-In.

Features
Storefront

Home page with banners, best sellers, and new products

Category & subcategory browsing, product detail with zoom, related/recommended items

Cart and Wishlist (persisted in localStorage but gated until login)

Ratings & Reviews (add / delete by the owner; live aggregate update)

‚ÄúGifting Studio‚Äù (AI suggests single/pair/bundle gifts by quick inputs)

Beautiful SweetAlert pop-ups for add-to-cart, wishlist, compare, etc.

Theme toggle (green/pink), animated brand, floating Home button

Search & Listings

Category by name or id

Powerful /search with brands, price range, rating, in-stock filter, sorting, pagination

AI (server-side)

/api/ai/chat ‚Äì intentful search responses + product blocks

/api/ai/recommend ‚Äì structured recommendations by taste (categories, brands, min rating, budget)

/api/ai/gift ‚Äì builds 1‚Äì3 item gift bundles

/api/ai/compare ‚Äì compares current product vs. others (same/other brands) using description + rating and returns a short summary

Auth & Users

Email/JWT auth with /auth/me, /auth/logout

Google Sign-In (frontend sends Google credential to /auth/google)

Logout uses a token blacklist (server rejects blacklisted JWTs)

Orders & History

Create order, view order/transaction history

‚ÄúSpent‚Äù summary in header after purchase

Environment Variables

Create /backend/.env:

# Server
PORT=4000
AUTH_PORT=5000

# Mongo
CONNECTION_STRING=mongodb://localhost:27017/aura

# JWT
JWT_SECRET=super-secret-string

# Cloudinary
cloudinary_Config_Cloud_Name=your_cloud_name
cloudinary_Config_api_key=your_api_key
cloudinary_Config_api_secret=your_api_secret

# Hugging Face (AI)
HF_API_KEY=hf_xxx_your_token


If you enabled Google login in the backend:

GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_oauth_client_id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_google_oauth_client_secret


Frontend uses the base URLs http://localhost:4000/api and http://localhost:5000/api.
The backend (app.js) intentionally listens on both ports so /auth/* can be called at 5000.

Getting Started
1) Clone & Install
git clone https://github.com/yourname/aura-mosaic.git
cd aura-mosaic

# Backend
cd backend
npm install
# Start server(s) on :4000 (plus mirror :5000 per app.js)
npm start   # or: npm run dev   (if you added nodemon)

# Frontend
cd ../frontend
npm install
npm start   # or: npm run dev (Vite)

2) Seed Data (optional)

Insert a few Categories and Products in MongoDB (via Compass or a small seed script) so the home & listings have content.

3) (Optional) Google Sign-In

Create an OAuth Client in Google Cloud ‚Üí Web, add http://localhost:3000 (or Vite port) as origin. Put client ID/secret in backend .env. Frontend posts Google credential to /api/auth/google.

How the AI Works (short)

Frontend calls our Express AI routes.

The server reads products/categories from MongoDB, ranks/filters them based on your query (budget, category/brand hints, rating).

For comparison (/ai/compare) it compiles short facts (price, rating, key words from description) and uses a light LLM call (Hugging Face Falcon-7B-Instruct) to write a brief, friendly summary and clear pick.

That summary is returned to the frontend and shown in a SweetAlert with a polished layout.

Auth Flow (short)

On login/Google login the server issues a JWT saved in localStorage.

Protected actions (wishlist, reviews, orders) send Authorization: Bearer <token>.

Logout adds the token to a server-side blacklist (utils/tokenBlacklist.js). Subsequent requests with that token are rejected.

Common Pitfalls / Troubleshooting

Mongo not running ‚Üí Start mongod.

CORS ‚Üí Server enables CORS; ensure front/back URLs match.

Ports busy ‚Üí Change PORT/AUTH_PORT in .env.

Gifting page ‚Äúkeeps refreshing‚Äù ‚Üí Usually caused by a useEffect re-render loop or navigation on missing user. Ensure its effects have correct dependency arrays and you‚Äôre signed in.

Cloudinary upload fails ‚Üí Verify cloud name/key/secret.
